    about: 'Three men have held the title of "The Fastest Man Alive"—Jay Garrick, Barry Allen and Wally West. Each of them redefined the word "hero."  The mysterious power known as the Speed Force is an energy field that has, over the centuries, granted incredible powers of velocity to certain heroes. The most famous of these is the Flash, also known as the Fastest Man Alive. Ever since the days of World War II, there has been a man clad in red who can run at impossible speeds, using his power to save lives and defend those who cannot defend themselves. All between the ticks of a second.  In the 1940s, college student Jay Garrick acquired his super-speed abilities in a random lab accident and became the first DC Super Hero to go by the name the Flash. Years later, Jay was succeeded by police scientist Barry Allen, until Barry’s former kid partner Wally West took up the mantle at a time when Barry was considered dead. But, when Barry returned, he became the Flash once again. All three generations of speedsters have been cornerstone members of both the Justice Society and Justice League.  The Flash has mastery over not just speed, but time itself, and he has often used his powers to travel though different eras and even into other dimensions. Although the Flash has not always been fast enough to outrun personal tragedy when it has come for him, he always does his best to prevent the same from happening to the people of Central City and Keystone City. In so doing, he has earned himself a spot among the greatest Super Heroes the DC Universe has ever known.',

Hal Jordan’s life was changed twice by crashing aircraft. The first time was when he witnessed the death of his father, pilot Martin Jordan. The second was when, as an adult and trained pilot himself, he was summoned to the crashed wreckage of a spaceship belonging to an alien named Abin Sur. Abin explained that he was a member of the Green Lantern Corps, an organization of beings from across the cosmos, armed with power rings fueled by the green energy of all willpower in the universe. Upon his death, Abin entrusted his ring and duties as the Green Lantern of Earth’s space sector to Hal Jordan.  Hal’s life as a Green Lantern has not been easy.

For Hal has sworn the oath of every Green Lantern—that no evil will escape his sight.',

Although he is commonly thought of by many as just a modern-day Robin Hood, the Green Arrow is so much more than that limited description would lead you to believe. Born to a life of wealth and privilege, Oliver Queen took it all for granted until tragedy struck at sea, leaving him alone on a deserted island. There, Queen had to dig deep to find out if he had the inner fortitude to survive. While stranded on this island, Oliver honed his already formidable archery skills into becoming the greatest archer ever known. When he finally returned to civilization, he embarked on a career as an urban vigilante, attempting to rid the streets of his hometown of Seattle, and also Star City, from crime and corruption with nothing but a bow and arrow. Viewed as a pampered playboy by the outside world, Green Arrow cares more about the plight of the poor and the suffering in America perhaps more than any other costumed superhero—a “social justice warrior” in the truest sense of the word. Although an imperfect man, prone to make mistakes in his personal life probably more than most other costumed crusaders, the Green Arrow is nevertheless one of the greatest heroes in the entire DC Universe. Whether fighting solo, with his paramour the Black Canary or with his fellow heroes of the Justice League, the Emerald Archer is one hero anyone would be lucky to have at their back.',

His only weakness in an inherent fear of fire, which all Martians have. All of these abilities make him one of the most powerful beings on the planet. But it is his brilliant mind and steady leadership style, along with his gentle soul, that have made him a beloved member of the League in all of its incarnations. Indeed, if there is one being whom the rest of the DC Super Hero community looks up to as their elder statesman and the voice of wisdom, it is the Manhunter from Mars.

So, what do you do if you’re the Boy Wonder to one of the most recognizable super heroes in the universe and you’re looking to break out on your own?  Simple. You become Nightwing. When his circus acrobat family was brutally murdered, Dick Grayson was taken in by billionaire and bat-friendly super hero Bruce Wayne. Bruce shared his secret life as Batman with the young boy and eventually molded him into Robin—the Dark Knight’s partner in Gotham. But as Dick grew older, playing second fiddle to the sternest hero in the Justice League began to wear on him, and eventually he struck out on his own, staying true to what he learned as Robin while coming into his own as a respected member of the super hero pantheon. His code, like his mentor’s, is simple—if you’re breaking the law on his turf, watch out. Anyone who doesn’t can expect a short and most assuredly painful trip to Arkham. Yet, while he may share methods and motivation with Batman, Dick knows what being Batman can do. He doesn’t want to become as dark, controlling and lonely as Bruce. But for all the good he’s accomplished while avoiding it, one question is unavoidable—without going as far as Batman, can Nightwing be as effective as he ultimately wants to be?',

He was succeeded by the brilliant Ted Kord, who had no powers to speak of, but carried on the Blue Beetle legacy with just his wits and his fists, along with a whole lot of gadgets and a sharp sense of humor. The most recent Blue Beetle is Jaime Reyes, a teenager from El Paso, Texas who bonded with Dan Garrett’s Scarab. The artifact gave him incredible alien armor which he used to defend his hometown from all manner of metahuman criminals.

A highly-trained martial artist and master of disguise, Dinah’s life hasn’t always been easy. Before her career as a musician took off, she spent most of her time just trying to survive on the streets of Gotham City. It was this rough upbringing that taught her the value of her strength and gave her the skills to fight—something that would later prove a huge asset as she put on a mask and became a superhero. Dinah spends her time working both solo and on various teams. Most notably, she helps with the Birds of Prey alongside her best friend and fellow hero, Barbara Gordon. But when she’s not fighting for the betterment of Gotham, chances are you can find her roaming Seattle alongside the on-again-off-again love of her life, Green Arrow.',
